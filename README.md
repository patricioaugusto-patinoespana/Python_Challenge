# Python Challenge 

# PyBank

We are going to analize the budget_data.csv with a main.jpynb, a Python file, that is going to show us:
  - Total number of months
  - The net total amount of Profit/Loses over the entire period
  - The changes of Profit/loses over the period and then the average of those changes
  - The greastes increase
  - The greatest decrease

# Files Include
In the PyBank folder you will find the Resources folder and the Analysis Folder and the main.jpynb file. In Resources folder we have 
the budget_data.csv file that contains the Profit or Losses per month, and we have to analyze this file with a main.jpynb file with Python, 
and the results were exported to a .txt file in the Analysis Folder.

# Instructions
Open de main.jpynb, a Python file with Jupyter NoteBook, the code is commented by section so you know what the code does, and run all code.

# Usage 
With this file we can calculate the Total months of the data, and also the net Profit / Losses depending the situation, the changes that the 
Profit / Losses have in the entire period, and the greatest increase and decrase. With this, we can do it by a few months, or any quantity 
of months you want to analyze. 

# Results
In this budget_data we can observe that que have 
- 86 months
- Net total: $22,564,198
- Average Change: $-8311.11
- Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
- Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
With this numbers we can say that we have Losses, because the Average Change is negative, so in this case we have more Losses than Profits, and
the greatest decrease is similar to the greatest increase, but the greates increase was on February 14, and the greatest increase was on August 16,
so in this case, we can say that at the biggining have more losses, but in the next months, they take over.

# PyPoll

We are going to analice the election_data file with a main.jpynb, a Phython file that is going to show us: 
- The total number of votes
- A complete list of candidates who received votes, the total number and the percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

# Files Include
In the PyPoll folder you will find the Resources folder and the Analysis Folder and the main.jpynb file. In Resources folder we have 
the election_data.csv file that contains the Profit or Losses per month, and we have to analyze this file with a main.jpynb file with Python, 
and the results were exported to a .txt file in the Analysis Folder.

# Instructions
Open de main.jpynb, a Python file with Jupyter NoteBook, the code is commented by section so you know what the code does, and run all code. 

<img width="1375" alt="PyPoll2" src="https://github.com/patricioaugusto-patinoespana/Python_Challenge/assets/139070248/e72aee9b-8809-40e8-ad3a-90d244fa5035">

# Usage 
With this file you are going to be able to calculate from a csv file with Data, the total votes that has been recived, but also the total votes 
for each candidate and the percentage that votes represent, and know who te winner is. 

# Results
In this election_data.csv file we can observe: 
Total Votes: 369711
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
Winner: Diana DeGette
The total votes were 369,711, from those votes 3.139% were for Raymon Anthony Doane that corresponds to 11,606 votes, then we have 23.049% for
Charles Casper Stockham that corresponds to 85,213 votes and then we have 73.812% to Diana DeGette that corresponds to 272,892 votes, so in this
case with this we can observe that the winner is Diana DeGette. With this votes for each one the sum is for the total votes, and also with this 
we have the 100% of the votes.
